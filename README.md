# Worldwide-Fundraising

## Problem Statement
The dashboard is too cluttered, making it hard to read and use effectively. As a result, account owners have missed key donor opportunities—potentially costing millions in fundraising. We need to improve readability and engagement to help users quickly spot important insights.

## Learning Objectives
- Enhance dashboard readability and user engagement through improved design techniques.
- Utilize conditional formatting to emphasize key values in widgets.
- Organize dashboard content into separate, animated pages for better navigation.
- Implement dynamic interactions to set a reference line based on a calculated average.

### Engage Users with Animated Pages

To help the team focus on donations, we’ll create a dedicated Donations page. To preserve any existing work, we'll keep the current page as our primary page. Then, to create the Donations page, we'll clone the primary page and remove any widgets that aren’t needed. Cloning pages save a lot of time compared to building pages and widgets from scratch.

You now have two pages: one with all the widgets and another specific to donations. The Donations link widget serves as the title for the area inside the container widget. Next, let’s build the Leaderboard page to evaluate account owner performance. We’ll use the Leaderboard link widget as the title for the container widget on this page.

## Create the Leaderboard Page
To analyze account owners and compare their performance with others, let’s create a leaderboard. A Leaderboard page can rank account owners. If the director would like to spark some friendly competition, account owners can use this board to see who’s the top performer.

To build the page, we clone the Donations page, remove the donation widgets, and then add the Top Account Owners chart from the Primary page.

## Create the Pipeline Page
Using the same process, create the Pipeline page by cloning the Leaderboard page, remove the existing chart and add the pipeline charts.

You’re done with the Pipeline page! Now you just need to build a way for users to navigate between pages. Let’s take care of that now.

## Bring Analytics to Life with Engaging Animations

You can use a Navigation widget to allow users to toggle between pages. But to create custom links and a cool, dynamic accordion effect, let’s use the link widgets we created.

In the Donations page, connect the Leaderboard link widget to the Leaderboard page by modifying the link widget properties
